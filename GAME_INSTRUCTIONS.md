Titan X Ultimate: Official User Manual
Welcome to the Titan X Ultimate Engine, the world’s most advanced AI-powered gesture control interface for gaming. This manual provides clear, 
step-by-step instructions on how to calibrate, control, and analyze your performance using our proprietary Vision Z technology.

1. System Initialization
Before launching, ensure your webcam is centered and your hands are fully visible in the frame.

Boot Sequence: Upon running the script, the system will optimize GPU pipelines and initialize the Neural Network.

Engine Selection: Use your keyboard to select your mode:

Press [1] for the Shooting Engine.

Press [2] for the Racing Engine.

Press [3] for the Flight Engine.

2. Shooting Engine [Mode 1]
The Shooter Engine uses a split-hand control system for tactical movement and combat.

Movement (Left Hand): Imagine a virtual joystick in the bottom-left.

Move hand Up/Down to walk (W/S).

Move hand Left/Right to strafe (A/D).

Aiming (Right Hand): Your hand position controls the mouse cursor.

Deadzone: There is a 70-pixel center deadzone to prevent jitter. Move your hand outside this center circle to move the crosshair.

Combat Gestures:

Firing: Close your right hand into a Fist (0 fingers visible).

Reload: Extend 4 or 5 fingers on your right hand to trigger the 'R' key.

3. Racing Engine [Mode 2]
Designed for high-speed precision, this engine automates acceleration while you focus on technical handling.

Steering: Hold both hands up as if holding a steering wheel.

Turn Right: Tilt your hands so the right hand is lower than the left (>8° angle).

Turn Left: Tilt your hands so the left hand is lower than the right (<-8° angle).

Pedal Control:

Braking: On both hands, show only 2 fingers (Index and Middle). This triggers the Down Arrow.

Nitro: Close both hands into Fists. This triggers the Spacebar for a speed boost.

Auto-Throttle: The system automatically holds 'W' for you while you are cruising.

4. Flight Engine [Mode 3]
The Flight Engine utilizes 3D spatial positioning to control your aircraft's attitude.

Roll (Banking): Tilting your hands left or right controls the wings.

Bank Right: Right hand significantly lower than left (>40 pixel difference).

Bank Left: Left hand significantly lower than right (<-40 pixel difference).

Pitch (Climb/Dive): Controlled by the average height of both hands.

Climb: Raise both hands toward the top of the camera frame.

Dive: Lower both hands toward the bottom of the camera frame.

Wings Level: Keeping your hands centered and horizontal will stabilize the flight.

5. Vision Z Data Analytics
Vision Z acts as your flight/race recorder to help you identify technical errors.

Start Recording: Press [0] on your keyboard to start logging data.

Generate Report: Press [0] again to stop. This will open the Titan X Report Interface.

PDF Export: Inside the report interface, press [9]. You will see a "Compiling Neural Data" animation. Once finished, a PDF will be generated and the folder containing it will automatically open.

Note: Ensure your race duration matches your active hand-tracking time for the most accurate timestamps.
